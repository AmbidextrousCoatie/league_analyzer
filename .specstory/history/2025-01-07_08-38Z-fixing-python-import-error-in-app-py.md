# Fixing Python Import Error in app.py (2025-01-07 08:38Z)

_**User (2025-01-07 09:35Z)**_

i got an error in app.py when importing data_access.read saying there is no such module

The error occurs because Python can't find the `data_access` module. This is likely because the module isn't in Python's path or the project structure isn't set up correctly. Here's how to fix it:

1. First, make sure you have a proper Python package structure. You should have a `data_access` directory with an `__init__.py` file in it.

2. Here's how to modify the import statement:

```python:presentation/app.py
# ... existing code ...
# Replace this line:
from data_access.read import read

# With one of these options:
# Option 1 - relative import (if data_access is in the same directory as app.py):
from .data_access.read import read

# Option 2 - absolute import (if data_access is one level up):
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
from data_access.read import read
# ... existing code ...
```

To properly fix this, you should ensure your project structure looks something like this:
```
your_project/
├── presentation/
│   ├── app.py
│   └── templates/
├── data_access/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── read.py
└── database/
    └── data/
        └── bowling_ergebnisse.csv
```

Choose the import option that matches your project structure. Option 2 is more robust if you're running the script from different locations.

Also, since you're using relative paths for your CSV file (`'../database/data/bowling_ergebnisse.csv'`), make sure you're running the script from the correct directory.
