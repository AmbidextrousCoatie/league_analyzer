# Fixing Undefined Function Error in Code (2025-01-07 22:51Z)

_**User (2025-01-07 23:10Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"calculate_score_average" is not defined
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Agent**_

The error occurs because `calculate_score_average` is called but not imported. Based on the naming pattern in your imports and the presence of similar functions, you should use `calculate_score_average_league` instead, which is already imported.

Here's the fix:

```python:test.py
// ...
# Change this line
season_average = calculate_score_average_league(filtered_df, filters={Columns.league_name: [all_leagues[0]], Columns.season: [all_seasons[0]]})
// ...
```

This change replaces the undefined `calculate_score_average` with the imported `calculate_score_average_league` function.
