# Team vs Team Colored Circles Fix

## Problem
The team vs team comparison table was missing the colored circles for team names in the first column. These circles are generated by the `teamColorMap` system and are widely used throughout the application (e.g., in league results match day tables).

## Root Cause
The JavaScript code in `components/tables.html` was only checking for the English title "Team vs Team Comparison" to trigger the special colored circle rendering, but the table title was internationalized and could be in German ("Team vs Team Vergleichsmatrix").

## Solution
Updated the JavaScript detection logic to check for both English and German versions of the title.

### **File**: `app/templates/components/tables.html`

#### **Before**:
```javascript
if (data.title && data.title.includes('Team vs Team Comparison') && groupIndex === 0 && index === 0) {
```

#### **After**:
```javascript
if (data.title && (data.title.includes('Team vs Team Comparison') || data.title.includes('Team vs Team Vergleichsmatrix')) && groupIndex === 0 && index === 0) {
```

## How It Works

### **Team Color System** 🎨
The colored circles are generated by the `teamColorMap` system:

1. **Team Color Mapping**: Each team gets a unique color from the `teamColorMap`
2. **Circle Generation**: JavaScript creates a 16px colored circle next to the team name
3. **Fallback Color**: If no color is found, uses `#888` (gray) as fallback

### **Detection Logic** 🔍
The system detects team vs team comparison tables by checking the title:
- **English**: "Team vs Team Comparison Matrix" → contains "Team vs Team Comparison"
- **German**: "Team vs Team Vergleichsmatrix" → contains "Team vs Team Vergleichsmatrix"

### **Rendering** 🎯
When detected, the first column (team names) gets special HTML:
```html
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 16px; height: 16px; border-radius: 50%; background-color: ${color}; margin-right: 8px;"></div>
    <span>${teamName}</span>
</div>
```

## Result

### **Visual Output**:
✅ **English Mode**: Team names with colored circles (e.g., "🔴 Team Name")  
✅ **German Mode**: Team names with colored circles (e.g., "🔴 Team Name")  
✅ **Consistent**: Matches other tables in the application  
✅ **Dynamic**: Colors change based on team selection and data  

### **Languages Supported**:
- **English**: "Team vs Team Comparison Matrix"
- **German**: "Team vs Team Vergleichsmatrix"

## Testing

1. **English Mode**: Navigate to team vs team comparison → should see colored circles
2. **German Mode**: Switch language to German → should still see colored circles
3. **Language Switch**: Change language → circles should remain visible
4. **Other Tables**: Verify other tables (like league results) still have colored circles

The team vs team comparison table now properly displays colored circles for team names in both English and German! 🎉
