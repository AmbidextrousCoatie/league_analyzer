# Content Blocks Empty Issue: Charts Render Successfully But Don't Appear

## 🐛 **Current Problem**

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: `team-history: Chart rendered successfully with 5 seasons`
- Console shows: `league-comparison: Rendered chart and table successfully`
- But the content block areas appear completely empty on the page
- No visual charts or content despite successful API calls and rendering

## 🔍 **Analysis**

### **What's Working:**
✅ API calls successful (`team-history: Fetching data from /team/get_team_history?team_name=Landshut+1`)  
✅ Data processing successful (5 seasons found)  
✅ Chart creation code runs without errors  
✅ Console reports successful rendering  
✅ Filter changes trigger content block updates  
✅ No Canvas reuse errors  

### **What's Not Working:**
❌ Visual content doesn't appear in the DOM  
❌ Canvas elements seem to have content but it's not visible  
❌ Content blocks show as empty despite "successful" rendering  

## 🤔 **Possible Causes**

### **1. Canvas Dimension Issues**
- Canvas elements may have zero visible dimensions
- Width/height attributes set but offsetWidth/offsetHeight could be 0
- CSS styling might be hiding or collapsing the canvas

### **2. Chart Library Issues**
- Chart.js might be creating charts but not attaching them properly
- Legacy chart functions might not be compatible with the content block approach
- Global chart instances might be conflicting

### **3. DOM Timing Issues**
- Charts created before canvas is properly rendered
- Bootstrap CSS not fully loaded when charts are created
- Content blocks rendering too early in DOM lifecycle

### **4. Container/Parent Issues**
- Parent containers might be hidden or collapsed
- Bootstrap card styling might be interfering
- Z-index or positioning issues hiding the charts

## 🔧 **Investigation Steps Taken**

### **Canvas Dimension Fixes:**
- ✅ Added explicit width/height attributes to canvas elements
- ✅ Added canvas sizing checks and fallbacks
- ✅ Added delays to ensure proper canvas initialization

### **Chart Destruction Improvements:**
- ✅ Enhanced destroyChart() methods to handle all chart instances
- ✅ Added comprehensive cleanup for orphaned charts
- ✅ Proper error handling for chart lifecycle

### **Debug Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Added debug route `/debug/content-blocks` for isolated testing
- ✅ Console logging shows successful data flow
- ✅ Created visual debug controls

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check Canvas Visibility**: Use browser dev tools to inspect canvas elements
2. **Verify Chart Instances**: Check if Chart.js instances are actually created
3. **CSS Investigation**: Look for CSS rules that might be hiding content
4. **Legacy Function Test**: Verify that legacy chart functions work in isolation

### **Debug Commands:**
```javascript
// Check canvas elements
document.getElementById('chartTeamHistory').offsetWidth
document.getElementById('chartLeagueComparison').offsetWidth

// Check chart instances
window.teamHistoryChart
window.chartLeagueComparisonInstance

// Check content block state
window.teamStatsApp.contentRenderer.debug()
```

### **Visual Inspection Checklist:**
- [ ] Canvas elements exist in DOM
- [ ] Canvas elements have non-zero dimensions
- [ ] Canvas elements are visible (not hidden by CSS)
- [ ] Chart.js instances are properly attached to canvas
- [ ] Parent containers are visible and properly sized
- [ ] No CSS conflicts hiding the content

## 🧪 **Testing Approach**

### **1. Isolated Canvas Test**
Create a simple test chart directly on the canvas to verify Chart.js works:

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('chartTeamHistory');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: { labels: ['A', 'B'], datasets: [{ data: [1, 2] }] }
});
```

### **2. Legacy Function Test**
Test legacy chart functions directly:

```javascript
createAreaChart_vanilla([1,2,3], [2,3,4], 'chartLeagueComparison', 'Test', ['A','B','C']);
```

### **3. Container Visibility Test**
Check if containers are properly visible:

```javascript
const container = document.getElementById('chartTeamHistory').parentElement;
console.log('Visible:', container.offsetWidth, container.offsetHeight);
```

## 📊 **Expected Resolution**

Once the root cause is identified, we expect:
- ✅ Charts will appear visually in the content block areas
- ✅ Team History chart shows position progression
- ✅ League Comparison chart shows area chart with team vs league performance
- ✅ League Comparison table shows detailed comparison data
- ✅ All content updates properly when filters change

## 🎮 **Current Status**

**Phase**: Debug and Investigation  
**Priority**: High (core functionality blocked)  
**Impact**: Content blocks appear broken to users despite working backend

**Next Action**: Browser dev tools inspection to check canvas visibility and Chart.js instance creation.
