## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Currently Working (Phase 1)
- League + Season + Week (MatchDayBlock)
- League + Season + Week + Team (TeamDetailsBlock)
- Basic League + Season (partial LeagueSeasonOverviewBlock)

### üöß Needs Backend Endpoints (Phase 2)
- League Only (LeagueAggregationBlock)
- Complete League + Season (missing timetable, averages)
- League + Season + Team (TeamSeasonBlock - not created yet)

### üìã Next Steps
1. **Create missing backend endpoints** for aggregation data
2. **Implement TeamSeasonBlock** for team season analysis
3. **Remove debugging logs** once system is stable
4. **Add loading states** for better UX

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading Strategy
- **Parallel Loading**: Multiple API calls simultaneously where possible
- **Caching**: Consider caching static data (league history, etc.)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Show available data immediately, load optional data later
- **Error Isolation**: One failed endpoint doesn't break entire view

### User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Show loading states during data fetch
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing data shows placeholder, not error
- **Responsive Design**: Charts and tables adapt to screen size
- **Consistent Navigation**: Filter changes maintain context where logical
