## Dependencies Between Phases

- **Phase 1** ✅ (Foundation) - Provides league context for all other phases
- **Phase 2** - Builds on Phase 1 for clutch performance context
- **Phase 3** - Uses Phase 2 data for opponent difficulty calculations
- **Phase 4** - Independent implementation (player data)
- **Phase 5** - May require data schema updates
- **Phase 6** - Builds on all previous phases
- **Phase 7** - Enhances all previous phases with interactivity

---

## Current Status
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: 🔄 READY TO START
- **Phase 3**: ⏳ WAITING
- **Phase 4**: ⏳ WAITING  
- **Phase 5**: ⏳ WAITING
- **Phase 6**: ⏳ FUTURE
- **Phase 7**: ⏳ FUTURE

## Notes
- Each phase can be implemented independently (except dependencies noted above)
- Frontend and backend can be developed in parallel for each phase
- Testing should be done after each phase completion
- Performance monitoring should be added as features are implemented
