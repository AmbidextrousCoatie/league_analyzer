# Test Reports

This directory contains test coverage reports and test results generated by pytest.

## Reports

- **`htmlcov/`** - HTML coverage report (open `index.html` in a browser)
- **`coverage.xml`** - XML coverage report (for CI/CD tools)
- **`coverage.json`** - JSON coverage report (for programmatic analysis)

## Generating Reports

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=domain --cov-report=html:test_reports/htmlcov --cov-report=xml:test_reports/coverage.xml --cov-report=json:test_reports/coverage.json
```

Or use the configured pytest.ini:

```bash
pytest
```

## Viewing HTML Report

Open `test_reports/htmlcov/index.html` in your web browser to see:
- Overall coverage percentage
- Coverage by file
- Line-by-line coverage highlighting
- Missing lines identification

## Coverage Goals

- **Domain Layer**: Target 80%+ coverage
- **Value Objects**: 100% coverage (critical business logic)
- **Entities**: 100% coverage (business rules)
- **Domain Services**: 90%+ coverage (calculation logic)

## Current Status

See the latest coverage report in `htmlcov/index.html` for current coverage statistics.

## Why Coverage Gaps Exist

Coverage gaps typically occur due to:

1. **Edge Cases**: Code paths that handle rare or error conditions
2. **Unused Code**: Methods or branches that aren't currently exercised
3. **Future Features**: Code prepared for features not yet implemented
4. **Error Handling**: Exception paths that are hard to trigger in tests
5. **Integration Points**: Code that requires external dependencies

As we add more tests and implement more features, coverage will increase.
